1.floating point addation takes more than one cycles.
2.a=b+c+d+f; floating and double can't use EXPRESSION_BALANCE; integer can.

3. ALways use pointer to pass the structure.
    
    D_point_or query_or_temp;
    #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=query_or_temp.x cyclic factor=480 dim=1 
    D_point_or feature_or_temp;
    #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=feature_or_temp.x cyclic factor=480 dim=1
    void dist_calc_or1(D_point_or feature_or, D_point_or query_or){}
    
    void dist_calc_or1(feature_or_temp, query_or_temp){}
    Will read data one byone fist and the partition cannot work in the function "dist_calc_or1".
